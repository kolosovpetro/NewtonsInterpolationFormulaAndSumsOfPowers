# Newton's interpolation formula and sums of powers

In this manuscript we derive the formulas for multifold sums of powers by utilizing
Newton's interpolation formula.
Furthermore, this manuscript provides the formulas for multifold sums of powers in terms of
Stirling numbers of the second kind, and Eulerian numbers.
