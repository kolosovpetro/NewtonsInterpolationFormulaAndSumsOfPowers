# Newton's interpolation formula and sums of powers

## Abstract

In this manuscript we derive formulas for multifold sums of powers by utilizing Newton's interpolation formula.
Furthermore, we provide formulas for multifold sums of powers in terms of Stirling numbers of the second kind and Eulerian numbers.
