In this manuscript we have discussed the formulas for multifold sums of powers by utilizing
Newton's interpolation formula.
Furthermore, this manuscript provides the formulas for multifold sums of powers in terms of
Stirling numbers of the second kind, and Eulerian numbers.
In addition, in~\eqref{sec:future-research} we discussed the future research directions, that may lead to a complete framework
for sums of powers, by means of combining interpolation approaches, binomial coefficients and variations of
hockey-stick identity.
The most important results of this manuscript is validated using Mathematica programs, see~\eqref{sec:mathematica-programs}.
