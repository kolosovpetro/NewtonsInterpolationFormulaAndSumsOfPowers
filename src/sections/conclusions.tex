In this manuscript we have derived formulas for multifold sums of powers by utilizing
Newton's interpolation formula.
Furthermore, we provide formulas for multifold sums of powers in terms of
Stirling numbers of the second kind, and Eulerian numbers.
In addition, in~\eqref{sec:future-research} we discuss the future research directions that may lead to a complete framework
for sums of powers, by means of combining interpolation approaches, binomial coefficients and variations of
the hockey-stick identity for binomial coefficients.
The most important results of this manuscript are validated using Mathematica programs, see~\eqref{sec:mathematica-programs}.
